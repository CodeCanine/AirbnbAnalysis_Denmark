# AirbnbAnalysis_Denmark

Tableau link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zoltan.mrsan/viz/OneNightinCopenhagen/Dashboard1#1

Data analysis with Python, SQL, and Tableau of Airbnb data in Denmark.

All data provided on: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/
Files used: listings.csv.gz and calendar.csv.gz from Denmark
All data revolves around Copenhagen only

This project is for practice purposese, to get more comfortable with Tableau, and general Data visualization.

Problem:

- When and where is it the most economic to rent on Airbnb in Copenhagen?
- What are the revenue expectation considering multiple metrics (location, dates, host status, bedrooms etc.)

Solution:

- Collecting data
- Cleaning data using MS Excel, MS Access or similar (MySql, PostgreSQL, SSMS, Azure etc.)
- Exploring more data with Python's Geopy library
- Gathering and visalizing data in Tableau

Challenges faced, and what is learned:

- After reading in the listing.csv file into excel, multiple data shared the same cell, which needed to be divided into further cells.
- For further data exploration, custom fields were required, that had to be calculated.
- calendar.csv has more than 4.5 million rows, that MS Excel can not handle, thus SQL database was needed.
- Since this was my second time using Tableau, and using it in depth analysis, it proved challenging to learn the tricks of the software

The visualization is available on Tableau Public.
Thank you for reading my project!
